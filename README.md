# Power-BI-Dashboards
Excited to present my latest "project: Sales Dashboard".

It gives an overview of key metrics and performance indicators. It typically includes graphs, charts, and tables to display information such as revenue, units sold, profit margins, top products, customer segments, and geographic sales distribution.

This dashboard helps businesses track their sales performance, identify trends, make informed decisions, and set targets for future growth.

Through interactive charts and graphs, stakeholders can effortlessly track milestones, analyze trends, and make informed decisions.
